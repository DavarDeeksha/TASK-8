# TASK-8

This project demonstrates how to modularize SQL logic using **stored procedures** and **user-defined functions (UDFs)**. It highlights the importance of reusability, abstraction, and conditional logic in SQL programming.

---

##  Objectives

- Learn to create and use **stored procedures** using `CREATE PROCEDURE`.
- Understand how to define and call **functions** using `CREATE FUNCTION`.
- Use **parameters** in procedures and functions for flexible logic.
- Apply **conditional logic** using `IF`, `CASE`, or control statements.
- Practice modular programming in SQL to simplify complex tasks.

##  Key Concepts

### ðŸ”¹ Stored Procedure
A stored procedure is a named collection of SQL statements that can be executed with a single call. It allows for conditional logic, loops, and parameters to be used efficiently.

**Use Cases:**
- Performing repetitive tasks
- Data validation and transformation
- Complex business logic

###  User-Defined Function (UDF)
Functions return a single value and are often used for computations or transformations that can be reused.

**Use Cases:**
- Returning calculated values
- String manipulation or date formatting
- Cleaning and formatting data
